End-of-file can be defined in many ways:
  If it is a manual input means if we click "ctrl + d" it means end of file. During this time, hasNext() gets false and ending loop.
HASNEXT IS A METHOD FROM SCANNER CLASS WHICH HELPS TO FIND IF THERE IS ANY MORE INPUT WE HAVE.

Scenario	                     |            How EOF Happens
Manual Input (Keyboard)	       |      Press Ctrl+D (Mac/Linux) or Ctrl+Z (Windows)
Reading a File	               |      EOF is reached when the last line is read
Command Line Redirection	     |      EOF happens automatically when the input file ends
Network Input (Socket/Stream)	 |      EOF occurs when the connection is closed

What is hasNext()?
 - hasNext() is a method in Scanner that checks if more input is available.
 - If thereâ€™s more input, it returns true.
 - If no input is left (EOF reached), it returns false, and the loop stops.

FLOW OF PROGRAM:
Step	                            |             What Happens?
Scanner is created	              |     Program waits for input
User enters a line	              |     hasNext() is true, so it reads and prints the line
User enters another line	        |   hasNext() is still true, so it continues
User presses EOF (Ctrl+D/Ctrl+Z)	|   hasNext() becomes false, loop stops
Program exits	                    |     Scanner is closed
